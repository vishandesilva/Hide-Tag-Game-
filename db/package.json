  "description": "Group Project For Web Programming 2019 - 2020\r ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r As per guidelines, we are supposed to make a Massively multiplayer game . \r -As such, we decided to make a game such that it would play like a hide and seek game but with a twist. The seeker starts off with a restricted range for his vision, he will only be able to see at a radius of 0.5 cm. \r -The hiders must make their way through the maze to get away from the seeker and will lose vision of other players after a certain duration such that it would not give them an advantage if caught. \r -Each time a player is caught, their FOV (Field of view) will be restricted to the same of that as the seeker as they join team seeker. \r -If both the seeker and the hider that is caught roams together, their FOV gets combined to a slightly larger radius of 1.25 cm, an extra 0.25cm to award for teamwork.\r -Every 30 seconds of gameplay will result in a dim pulsating light to aid with catching the hiders, it will only cover a proportion of the screen and not the whole screen.\r -As the timer ticks there will be a waypoint for the seeker to a hider that has been idle for more than 1 minute to avoid players going AFK (Away From Keyboard) and keep the game more active. \r -Buffs will apply to the seeker over time to give him boosts in catching players, such as speed boosts.\r -These will also apply to the hiders that have been caught. But with this, the seeker will also get a drawback, when they use their boosts, they will have a smaller FOV. \r -There will be a ratio of hider’s to seeker’s such that it would supply a multitude of people gameplay, the ratio is yet to be decided but is agreed to be 6:1. \r -The game is yet to be decided, whether it’s at a 100 player intake, if there would be multiple players as a game of 5 rounds is played and the player with the highest multiplier score wins.\r -This means the player that survives the longest, or the seeker that has caught the most amount of players. A randomizer would choose different seekers each match.",
